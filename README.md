## A test piece for GCN by me, Ben Havery

I got a little carried away while working on this so every page in the main nav menu got reproduced; there's plenty to see if you poke around!

## Things that have changed

- Presenters are nested in the nav menu.
- The active page is indicated in the nav menu.
- Videos on the homepage are grouped by publish date.
- A new layout keeps the header visible while scrolling content, so the nav menu is easier to get to from the bottom of the page.
- The header is also visible while scrolling the nav menu, so the menu is easier to close.
- The nav menu and hamburger have a transition.
