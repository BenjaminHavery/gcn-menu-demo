This is a test piece for GCN by me, Ben Havery.

I got a little carried away while building this so every page in the main nav menu got reproduced; there's plenty to see if you poke around!

## Things that have changed

- Presenters are nested in the nav menu.
- The active page is indicated in the nav menu.
- A new layout keeps the header visible while scrolling content, so the nav menu is easier to get to from the bottom of the page.
- The header is also visible while scrolling the nav menu, so the menu is easier to close.
- The nav menu and hamburger have a transition.
- Videos on the homepage are grouped by publish date.

## To view this project

You can either:
- Visit , or
- Download the /out directory and open index.html

## To develop this project

Clone the repository and then run the following:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```








```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
